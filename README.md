# reko - a general purpose decompiler.

**Reko** (Swedish: "decent, obliging") is a C# project containing
a decompiler for machine code binaries.  This project is freely
available under the GNU General Public License.

The project consists of front ends, core decompiler engine, and back
ends to help it achieve its goals.  A command-line, a Windows GUI,
and a ASP.NET front end exist at the time of writing.  The decompiler
engine receives inputs from the front ends in the form of either
individual executable files or decompiler project files. Reko
project files contain additional information about a binary file,
helpful to the decompilation process or for formatting the output.
The decompiler engine then proceeds to analyze the input binary.

Please note that many software licenses prohibit decompilation or
other reverse engineering of their machine code binaries. Use this
decompiler only if you have legal rights to decompile the binary
(for instance if the binary is your own.)

## Hacking

To build reko, start by cloning https://github.com/uxmal/reko. You
can use an IDE or the command line to build the solution file
`Reko-decompiler.sln`. If you are an IDE user, use Visual
Studio 2013 or later, or MonoDevelop version 5.10 or later. If you
wish to build using the command line, use the command:

```cmd
msbuild Reko-decompiler.sln
```

### Warnings and errors related to WiX

You will receive warnings or errors when loading the solution in Visual Studio
or MonoDevelop if you haven't installed the WiX toolset on your
development machine. You can safely ignore the warnings; the WiX
toolset is only used when making MSI installer packages, and isn't even
supported in MonoDevelop. You will not need to build an installer if
you're already able to compile the project: the build process copies
all the necessary files into If you do want to build an MSI installer
with the WiX toolchain, you can download it here:
http://wixtoolset.org/releases/

### How do I start Reko?

The solution folder `Drivers` contains the executables that act
as user interfaces: the directory `WindowsDecompiler` contains
the GUI client for Windows users; `MonoDecompiler` contains the GUI
client for Mono users; `CmdLine` is a command line driver.
