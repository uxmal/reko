This directory is used to store external dependencies, 
such as .NET assemblies or DLLs needed to compile and/or run the Reko project.

External dependencies are stored in subdirectories to this one, following the pattern
    <component-name>-<version>
Subdirectories to this subdirectory are at your discretion, but please make an effort
to be consistent across components.
