<BODY>
<H1><A name=PDPinst>What is the PDP-11 instruction set?</A></H1>
<P>The instruction set of the PDP-11 was designed towards a clean, general, 
symmetric instruction set. It can be used as a register-based, stack-based, or 
memory-based machine, depending on the programmer's preferences. Interrupt 
responsiveness is also important, supported with multiple interrupt levels for 
real-time computing as well as allowing for a separate interrupt handler for 
each device that generates interrupts. </P>
<P>Word length is 16 bits with the leftmost, most significant bit (MSB) being 
bit 15. There are eight general registers of 16 bits each. Register 7 is the 
program counter (PC) and, by convention, Register 6 is the stack pointer (SP). 
There is also a Processor Status Register/Word (PSW) which indicates the 4 
condition code bits (N, Z, V, C), the Trace Trap bit, processor interrupt 
priority, and 4 bits for current and previous operating modes. Addressing on the 
-11 is linear from memory address 0 through 177777. Memory management allows 
access to physical memory with addresses of up to 22 bits (17777777). All I/O 
devices, registers etc are addressed as if they were part of memory. These live 
in the 4KW of reserved memory space at the top of the addressing range. 
Additionally, on most implementations of the PDP-11 architecture, the 
processor's registers are memory-mapped to the range 17777700-17777717 (there 
are many control registers beyond just the general registers, the specifics vary 
between implementations). Thus Register 2 (R2) has an address of 17777702. All 
word memory addresses are even, except for registers. In byte operations, an 
even address specifies the least-significant byte and an odd address specifies 
the most-significant byte. Specifying an odd byte in a word operation will 
return an odd address trap. Memory addresses from 0 to 400 octal are reserved 
for various exception traps such as timeouts, reserved instructions, parity, 
etc., and device interrupts. </P>
<P>Addressing for the Single Operand, Double Operand and Jump instructions is 
achieved via six bits: </P><PRE>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|_|_|_|
                         |Mode |Reg  |
</PRE>
<P>where the modes are as follows: (Reg = Register, Def = Deferred) </P><PRE>     Mode 0  Reg           Direct addressing of the register
     Mode 1  Reg Def       Contents of Reg is the address
     Mode 2  AutoIncr      Contents of Reg is the address, then Reg incremented
     Mode 3  AutoIncrDef   Content of Reg is addr of addr, then Reg Incremented
     Mode 4  AutoDecr      Reg is decremented then contents is address
     Mode 5  AutoDecrDef   Reg is decremented then contents is addr of addr
     Mode 6  Index         Contents of Reg + Following word is address
     Mode 7  IndexDef      Contents of Reg + Following word is addr of addr
</PRE>
<P>Note that the right-most bit of the mode is an indirection bit. 
<P>Although not special cases, when dealing with R7 (aka the PC), some of these 
operations are called different things: </P><PRE>                          _ _ _ _ _ _
                         |x|x|x|1|1|1|
                         |Mode |  R7 |

     Mode 2  Immediate     Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 3  Absolute      Address of Operand follows the instruction
     Mode 6  Relative      Instr address+4+Next word is Address
     Mode 7  RelativeDef   Instr address+4+Next word is Address of address
</PRE>
<P>Mainstream instructions are broken into Single operand and Double operand 
instructions, which in turn can be word or byte instructions. </P>

<P>Bit 15, b, generally selects between word-sized (b=0) and byte-sized (b=1) 
operands. In the table below, the mnemonics and names are given in the order 
b=0/b=1. Unless otherwise stated, the operand is read for the data to operate 
on, and the result is then written over that data. </P>
<P>The single operand instructions are: </P>
<DL>
  <DT>b 000 000 011 dddddd -- SWAB/BPL <I>Swap Bytes/Branch Plus</I> 
  <DD>Swap bytes exchanges the two bytes found in the destination, writing the 
  result back to it. 
  <P>The branch (b=1) is described in the section on branches, below. 
  <P>Note that SWAB is actually a bit pattern from the range reserved for 
  branches. This particular pattern is otherwise unused, as it would be a 
  modification of BR, Branch Always, which has no obvious semantics. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 101 000 dddddd -- CLR/CLRB <I>Clear Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Sets all the bits in destination to zero. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 101 001 dddddd -- COM/COMB <I>Complement Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Calculates the ones-complement of the operand, and stores it. The 
  ones-complement is formed by inverting each bit (0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;0) 
  independently. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 010 010 dddddd -- INC/INCB <I>Increment Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Adds one to the destination. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 101 011 dddddd -- DEC/DECB <I>Decrement Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Subtracts one from the destination. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 101 100 dddddd -- NEG/NEGB <I>Negate Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Calculates the twos-complement of the operand, and stores it. The 
  twos-complement is formed by adding one to the ones-complement. The effect is 
  the same as subtracting the operand from zero. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 101 101 dddddd -- ADC/ADCB <I>Add Carry Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Adds the current value of the carry flag to the destination. This is 
  useful for implementing arithmetic subroutines with more than word-sized 
  operands. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 101 110 dddddd -- SBC/SBCB <I>Subtract Carry Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Subtracts the current value of the carry flag from the destination. This 
  is useful for implementing arithmetic subroutines with more than word-sized 
  operands. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 101 111 dddddd -- TST/TSTB <I>Test Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Sets the N (negative) and Z (zero) condition codes based on the value of 
  the operand. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 110 000 dddddd -- ROR/RORB <I>Rotate Right Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Rotates the bits of the operand one position to the right. The right-most 
  bit is placed in the carry flag, and the carry flag is copied to the left-most 
  bit (bit 15) of the operand. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 110 001 dddddd -- ROL/ROLB <I>Rotate Left Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Rotates the bits of the operand one position to the left. The left-most 
  bit is placed in the carry flag, and the carry flag is copied to the 
  right-most bit (bit 0) of the operand. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 110 010 dddddd -- ASR/ASRB <I>Arithmetic Shift Right Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Shifts the bits of the operand one position to the right. The left-most 
  bit is duplicated. The effect is to perform a signed division by 2. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 110 011 dddddd -- ASL/ASLB <I>Arithmetic Shift Left Word/Byte</I> 
  <DD>Shifts the bits of the operand one position to the left. The right-most 
  bit is set to zero. The effect is to perform a signed multiplication by 2. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 110 100 dddddd -- MARK/MTPS <I>Mark/Move To Processor Status</I> 
  <DD>Mark is used as part of one of the subroutine call/ return sequences. The 
  operand is the number of parameters. 
  <P>MTPS is only on LSI-11s, and is used to move a byte to the processor status 
  word. This is needed because the LSI-11 does not support accessing registers 
  via memory addresses. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 110 101 dddddd -- MFPI/MFPD <I>Move From Prev. Instruction/Data</I> 
  <DD>Pushes a word onto the current R6 stack from the operand address in the 
  previous address space, as indicated in the PSW. On PDP-11s that do not 
  support separate instruction and data spaces, MFPD is treated the same as 
  MFPI. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 110 110 dddddd -- MTPI/MTPD <I>Move To Previous Instruction/Data</I> 

  <DD>Pops a word from the current stack as indicated in the PSW to the operand 
  address in the previous address space, as indicated in the PSW. On PDP-11s 
  that do not support separate instruction and data spaces, MTPD is treated the 
  same as MTPI. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>b 000 110 111 dddddd -- SXT/MFPS <I>Sign Extend/Move From Processor 
  Status</I> 
  <DD>SXT sets the destination to zero if the N (negative) flag is clear, or to 
  all ones if N is set. This is useful for implementing arithmetic subroutines 
  with more than word-sized operands. 
  <P>MFPS copies the processor status byte to the indicated register. This only 
  exists on LSI-11s, and is needed there because those systems don't support 
  accessing registers via memory addresses. </P></DD></DL>

</PRE>
<P>The destination of a branch is +127 to -128 words from the word following the 
branch instruction itself. This seems slightly odd, until you realize the 
sequence of events: the branch instruction is read from memory and the PC 
incremented. If the branch is to be taken, the offset is then added to the 
current value of the PC. Since the PC has already been incremented, the offset 
is thus relative to the following word. Note that all branch instructions are 
one word long. </P>
<P>The various branches test the values of specific condition codes, and if the 
tests succeed, the branch is taken. The condition codes are N (negative), Z 
(zero), C (carry), and V (overflow). In the table below, the branch tests are 
shown as boolean expressions. `x' stands for exclusive-OR. `v' stands for 
inclusive-OR. </P>

                  MOV (R6)+,&lt;source&gt;
</PRE><BR>
  <P>This is the reverse of JSR. Obviously, the finesse here too is that you can 
  use the PC, to get what people normally consider a CALL/RETURN function. 
  <P>Why is it done like this then? Well, consider this example: <PRE>                  ...
                       JSR   R0,FOO
                       .WORD A
                       .WORD B
                       MOV   R1,C
                  ...

                  FOO: MOV   @(R0)+,R1

</PRE><BR>
  <P>This type of parameter passing is used extensively in the PDP-8 and 
  PDP-10), for example. Also, the FORTRAN runtime system on the PDP-11 do it 
  this way. (It is fairly easy to write a compiler who generates such a calling 
  sequence, and then have a library of functions which expect this calling 
  convention.) </P></DD></DL><PRE>                      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
