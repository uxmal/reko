        // Gap resolution

        // find all valid instruction sequences

        //   or : last instr is non-intra-procedure control
        //
        // Instruction sequences are found by considering each
        //byte between the start and the end of the gap as a potential
        //start of a valid instruction sequence. Subsequent
        //instructions are then decoded until the instruction sequence
        //either meets or violates one of the necessary conditions
        //defined above. When an instruction sequence
        //meets a necessary condition, it is considered possibly
        //valid and a sequence score is calculated for it. The sequence
        //score is a measure of the likelihood that this instruction
        //sequence appears in an executable. It is calculated
        //as the sum of the instruction scores of all instructions
        //in the sequence. The instruction score is similar to
        //the sequence score and reflects the likelihood of an individual
        //instruction. Instruction scores are always greater
        //or equal than zero. Therefore, the score of a sequence
        //cannot decrease when more instructions are added. We
        //calculate instruction scores using statistical techniques
        //and heuristics to identify improbable instructions.
        //The statistical techniques are based on instruction probabilities
        //and digraphs. Our approach utilizes tables that
        //denote both the likelihood of individual instructions appearing
        //in a binary as well as the likelihood of two instructions
        //occurring as a consecutive pair. The tables
        //were built by disassembling a large set of common executables
        //and tabulating counts for the occurrence of each
        //individual instruction as well as counts for each occurrence
        //of a pair of instructions. These counts were subsequently
        //stored for later use during the disassembly of
        //an obfuscated binary. It is important to note that only instruction
        //opcodes are taken into account with this technique;
        //operands are not considered. The basic score
        //for a particular instruction is calculated as the sum of
        //the probability of occurrence of this instruction and the
        //probability of occurrence of this instruction followed by
        //the next instruction in the sequence.

        //In addition to the statistical technique, a set of heuristics
        //are used to identify improbable instructions. This
        //analysis focuses on instruction arguments and observed
        //notions of the validity of certain combinations of operations,
        //registers, and accessing modes. Each heuristic is
        //applied to an individual instruction and can modify the
        //basic score calculated by the statistical technique. In our
        //current implementation, the score of the corresponding
        //instruction is set to zero whenever a rule matches. Examples
        //of these rules include the following:
        //• operand size mismatches;
        //• certain arithmetic on special-purpose registers;
        //• unexpected register-to-registermoves (e.g., moving
        //from a register other than %ebp into %esp);
        //• moves of a register value into memory referenced
        //by the same register.

        //        When all possible instruction sequences are determined,
        //the one with the highest sequence score is selected as the
        //valid instruction sequence between b1 and b2.
