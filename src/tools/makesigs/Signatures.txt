============================
What are signature files
========================

A library file contents a function in binary format, the function name and a few other bits of information 
that can assist in the decomplication process. A signature file is a representation of the library in a format
so then signature analysis is carried out the decompile can automatically rename procedures to the library name.
This can assist the person doing the investigation to either find a procedure in the executable code, of help eliminate
chucks of code from the investigation. Either way it’s a help.


---------------------------------------------
Create a signature file
========================

Currently the Signature maker tool only supports Archive files (.lib and.a) which either COFF or ELF object files.
People can add further processing here following the current model.
Run the commandline tool makesigs passing in the name of the library and the output destination.

-------------------------------------------------

Location of Signature files
===========================
In the directory of the Reko binary create a directory called 'Sigs'. This is the location to store the signatures files.
So that the Signature analysis is speed up, signature files are stored in sub directory’s which relate to the decompiled 
apps architecture the list of architectures Reko supports is as follows:-

mips-be-32
mips-le-32
mips-be-64
mips-le-64
ppc-be-32
ppc-le-32
sparc32
x86-protected-32
x86-protected-64
xtensa
arm
arm-64
m68k
avr8
msp430
risc-v
superH-le
superH-be
alpha
zSeries

Place the generated signature file into the correct directory.

Running signature files against a binary
========================================

Reko just does this, as the second phase of the decomplication process.
Reko looks into the environment directory matching the binary being decompiled and loads all of the relevant signatures.
It then checks every procedure for length and if any signatures have the same length it will then check for a match. If one is found it will automatically rename the procedure.
If several options are found, the procedure address and the list of the possible matches are display in the diagnostic window allow the user to make the choose and rename the procedure accordingly.
