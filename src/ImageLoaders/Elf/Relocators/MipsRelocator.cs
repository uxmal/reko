            ---------------------------------------

            Julien TINNES <julien at cr0.org>

            You may have been surprised that while reverse engineering MIPS ELF executables with IDA, you don't get any XREF for local procedure calls, nor for external procedure calls.
            This is due to the way the functions are called, using a classic GOT/PLT mecanism.

            The ABI states that every function must be called through jalr $t9. This means that at the begining of a given function, $t9 holds the current virtual address. The very first instructions of the function will be something like:

            lui	$gp, 0xFC0
            addiu	$gp, 0x76E0
            addu	$gp, t9

            which IDA will simplify as:

            li	$gp, 0xFC076E0
            addu	$gp, $t9

            the value 0xFC076E0 is calculated by the compiler in such a way that $gp will hold a "global pointer" value which is constant in the program.
            This value is always OFFSET_GP_GOT bytes after the program's GOT (global offset table), OFFSET_GP_GOT is always 0x7ff0.

            So, if you need to calculate $gp's value, you can add OFFSET_GP_GOT to the address of the GOT (which you can retrieve through the ELF dynamic table, under the entry: MIPS_RLD_VERSION). Or you can look at the begining of the function and add the function's virtual address and the magic value (see li).

            Here on my executable, GOT is at 0x10000030, so general $gp's value is 0x10008020

            Now if we need to call an internal function (in the same ELF file), we'll do something like:
            lw	$t9, -0x7Fb4($gp)
            nop
            jalr $t9

            in my GOT, at address 0x1000006c I have a pointer to my local function.

            Now how does it work if we call an external function ? Well it's pretty similar to the way it works on Intel with PLT/GOT. The pointer in the GOT will point to a 4 instructions stub in .text section which is:

            lw	$t9, -0x7FF0($gp)
            move	$t7, $ra
            jalr	$t9
            li	$t8, SYM_INDEX

            where SYM_INDEX depends on the external function you want to call. What it does is load the first entry of the GOT (always) into $t9, save the return address in $t7, load an index in $t8 (remember the delay slot ;), and call $t9 which now points to dl_linux_resolve (in ld.so) (also called _dl_runtime_resolve). This first entry in the GOT is initialized at runtime by the dynamic loader.
            dl_linux_resolve will call __dl_runtime_resolve with $t8 and (the program's) $gp as arguments. dl_runtime_resolve will patch the corresonding (to $t8, which is an index) GOT entry, then it'll put $t7 (the saved return address, remember) in $ra and jump to the now resolved function (returned by __dl_runtime_resolve in $v0).

            What is really interesting is to know how dl_runtime_resolve works, this would allow us to write an IDA plugin:

            Here's an algorithm you can use:

            Search DT_SYMTAB in the dynamic section (you can try with readelf -d)

            Read this symbol table (readelf -s)

            Read DT_PLTGOT, DT_MIPS_LOCAL_GOTNO et DT_MIPS_GOTSYM in dynamic section.

            now, dyngot=DT_PLTGOT + (DT_MIPS_LOCAL_GOTNO - DT_MIPS_GOTSYM)*(POINTER_SIZE (4 on 32 bits))

            Now in the dynamic symbol table (found with DT_SYMTAB) (his name is probably
            .dynsym anyway), from index DT_MIPS_GOTSYM, the names are corresponding to the
            functions' PLT stubs pointed to by dyngot[index-DT_MIPS_GOTSYM] entries. Make
            each dyngot entry an offset and change his name to the name found in the
            dynamic symbol table and you're done.
