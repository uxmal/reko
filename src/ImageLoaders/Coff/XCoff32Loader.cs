In implementations that permit compilers and assemblers to generate multiple .data sections, there must be a csect of type XMC_TC0 in each section that contains data that is referenced (by way of a relocation entry) as a TOC-relative data item.Some hardware architectures limit the value that a relative displacement field within a load instruction may contain.This limit then becomes an inherent limit on the size of a TOC for an executable XCOFF object.

The symbols might be in either the local executable XCOFF object or another executable XCOFF object. The binder uses special processing semantics to eliminate duplicate TOC entries as follows:
            // Symbols that have a storage class value of C_EXT are global symbols and must have names(a non-null n_name field). These symbols require no special TOC processing logic to combine duplicate entries.Duplicate entries with the same n_name value are combined into a single entry.
            // Symbols that have a storage class value of C_HIDEXT are not global symbols, and duplicate entries are resolved by context.Any two such symbols are defined as duplicates and combined into a single entry whenever the following conditions are met:
            // The n_name fields are the same. That is, they have either a null name or the same name string.
            // Each is the same size as a pointer.
            // Each has a single RLD entry that references external symbols with the same name.
            // To minimize the number of duplicate TOC entries that the binder cannot combine, compilers and assemblers should adhere to a common naming convention for TOC entries. By convention, compilers and assemblers produce TOC entries that have a storage class value of C_HIDEXT and an n_name string that is the same as the n_name value for the symbol that the TOC entry addresses.
